## Instructions

To initialise the project after cloning you'll have to follow these steps from the Server directory:

- Install dependencies with composer
- Gerenate app key
- Adjust your database creds (I used sqlite)
- Migrate
- Seed
- Run the server

In the Client directory, install dependencies first then run the app
